### The Adolescence of Technology  

I believe deeply in our ability to **prevail**, in humanity’s spirit and its **nobility**, but we must face the situation **squarely** and without illusions.  
This **vacillation** is unfortunate, as the technology itself doesn't care about what is fashionable, and we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023.   
The lesson is that we need to discuss and address risks in a realistic, pragmatic manner: sober, fact-based, and well equipped to survive **changing tides**.  
It’s thus very important for regulations to be **judicious**: they should seek to avoid **collateral damage**, be as simple as possible, and impose the least burden necessary to get the job done.

The implicit assumption that AI models are necessarily **monomaniacally** focused on a single, coherent, narrow goal, and that they pursue that goal in a clean, consequentialist manner.

Millions of people talk to Claude about an **astonishingly** diverse range of topics...

We can try to develop an understanding by correlating the model’s “**neurons**” and “**synapses**” to **stimuli** and behavior.  
**Surgical interventions**.  
There is also a genuine risk that **overly** **prescriptive** legislation ends up imposing tests or rules that don’t actually improve safety but that waste a lot of time.  
those of us who believe in this cause should make our case that these risks are real and that our fellow citizens need to **band** together to protect themselves.

why Zhang’s **ouster** could lead to younger lieutenants, whether more experienced or not, take helm to make Xi’s goal a reality.  
Even more important than scale is **doctrine**. The PLA has moved away from rigid Soviet-style command toward decentralized **combined-arms** operations that emphasize initiative at lower levels and a shift toward network-centric **warfare**.  
More stories will likely emerge in the near future, some planted by CCP **psyops** and some by U.S. agents, to push a narrative that will **straddle** between two truths...
